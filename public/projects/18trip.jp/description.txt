## Project overview

**Project name:** 18trip.jp

**Project type:** Travel / Experience listing and booking site (adapt this to exact purpose)

**Project summary (short):**
A responsive, SEO-friendly travel experiences website that allows users to discover, browse, and (optionally) book curated trips, activities and guides in Japan. The site focuses on clean UX, fast performance, image-first content, and easy content management for editors.

**My role:** Full-stack developer — responsible for architecture, frontend, backend API design, database schema, CI/CD, deployment, performance tuning, SEO and accessibility improvements, and integration with third-party services. (If you worked with others, replace "Full-stack" with your actual role and credit collaborators.)

**Project duration & timeline:**

* Planning & wireframes: 1–2 weeks
* MVP development (core listing pages, search, single-trip pages): 4–6 weeks
* CMS / editorial & admin tooling: 2–3 weeks
* Performance, SEO and polishing: 1–2 weeks
* Launch & post-launch fixes: 2–4 weeks

*(Replace with real start/end dates or sprint counts.)*

## Goals & success criteria

* Deliver a modern, fast, and mobile-first listing site for travel experiences.
* Achieve sub-2s first meaningful paint on mobile and desktop.
* SEO-optimized pages to compete for long-tail travel-related keywords.
* Enable non-technical editors to add and update content via a CMS or admin panel.
* Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA as baseline) for major pages.

---

## Tech stack (what I used and why)

* **Frontend:** React (or Vue/Nuxt/Next) — component-driven UI, SSR/SSG options for SEO.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or custom SCSS — fast development and consistent spacing system.
* **Routing / SSR:** Next.js (recommended) or Nuxt for server-side rendering and static generation for SEO-critical pages.
* **Backend / API:** Node.js + Express/Fastify or a serverless approach (AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions) — lightweight, fast, scalable.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data (trips, users, bookings) and Redis for caching and rate-limiting.
* **Storage & CDN:** S3-compatible storage for images + CloudFront / BunnyCDN / Fastly for global delivery.
* **Search:** Algolia or Elasticsearch for instant, typo-tolerant search and filters.
* **Authentication:** JWT-based auth with refresh tokens or OAuth for third-party logins.
* **CMS / Admin:** Strapi / Contentful / Netlify CMS or a custom admin UI powered by the same API for editors.
* **Analytics:** Google Analytics / GA4 + Google Search Console and optionally Hotjar for session recording.
* **Deployment:** Vercel or Netlify (frontend), Heroku / Railway / AWS ECS or serverless for backend.
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for test, build, lint and deploy pipelines.

*If you used different tools, replace these with the exact technologies you used.*

## Architecture & data flow (high-level)

1. **Client**: React SPA with server-side rendering for public pages (Next.js). Static generation for trip pages where possible.
2. **Edge / CDN**: CDN serves pre-rendered static assets and images.
3. **API Gateway / Server**: Node.js API provides JSON endpoints for search, detail pages, admin operations and user auth.
4. **Database**: PostgreSQL stores canonical data: trips, locations, categories, user profiles, bookings, reviews.
5. **Cache**: Redis caches frequently-read API responses (top listings, home page) and stores session tokens.
6. **Search**: Index trip pages to Algolia for fast, filtered searches.
7. **CMS**: Editors create content via Strapi or a curated admin panel; content triggers re-indexing and static regeneration.

## Key features implemented

### 1) Homepage & discovery

* Hero image carousel with fast LCP optimization (below).
* Curated categories and location chips.
* Trending/featured experiences with lazy loading and placeholder images.

### 2) Search & filtering

* Instant search with autocomplete (Algolia) and multi-facet filters (price, duration, difficulty, region).
* URL-synced query parameters so results are shareable and crawable.

### 3) Trip detail pages

* High-quality hero image, gallery with responsive `srcset` and `loading="lazy"`.
* Structured data (JSON-LD) for schema.org `TouristTrip` / `Event` to enhance SERP appearance.
* Clear CTA (contact / booking) with progress / modal booking flow.

### 4) Editorial & Admin

* Editor interface for adding trips, images, tags, structured itineraries, highlights, and FAQs.
* Image upload pipeline with resizing, WebP conversion and alt-text prompts.

### 5) User auth & booking (if applicable)

* Secure auth endpoints, session handling, reservation creation, confirmation emails.
* Integration with a payment gateway (Stripe) with server-side payment intents and webhooks.

### 6) Internationalization (optional)

* Locale-aware routes and `hreflang` tags for SEO when supporting Japanese and other languages.

## Frontend details

* **Component design:** Atomic pattern — `Hero`, `TripCard`, `FilterPanel`, `Gallery`, `BookingModal`.
* **State management:** React Query (for server state) + local component state for UI interactions. Query keys structured by filters to enable caching and background refresh.
* **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, keyboard navigable carousels, skip links, form labels and ARIA attributes where necessary. Color contrast checks.
* **Responsive:** Mobile-first breakpoints with fluid typography and image sizes. Performance budget set for mobile.
* **Image handling:** Generated multiple sizes and formats (`avif`/`webp`) using build-time or upload-time processing (Sharp). Served via CDN.
* **SSR/SSG:** Implemented pre-rendering for the most trafficked trip pages and dynamic server-side rendering for search results to keep content fresh.

---

## Backend details

* **API design:** RESTful endpoints with clear resource separation: `/api/trips`, `/api/search`, `/api/users`, `/api/bookings`.
* **Validation:** Joi/Zod for request validation and type-safety.
* **Security:** Rate limiting, input sanitization, helmet for HTTP headers, and secure cookie settings.
* **Email:** Transactional emails via SendGrid or SES for booking confirmations and password resets.
* **Webhooks:** Payment gateway webhook handlers to confirm and finalize bookings.

---

## DevOps, CI/CD & deployment

* **Repo structure:** Monorepo with `apps/web` and `apps/api` (or separate repos if preferred).
* **CI pipeline:** GitHub Actions flow: lint → unit tests → build → deploy. PR checks enforced.
* **Preview environments:** Auto-deployed preview for each pull request (Vercel/Netlify preview) so stakeholders can review changes.
* **Monitoring & logs:** Sentry for frontend and backend error monitoring; Papertrail/LogDNA for aggregated logs.
* **Backup & migrations:** Managed DB backups and migration scripts via Knex/TypeORM/Flyway.

---

## Performance optimizations

* **Critical rendering path:** Critical CSS inlined for hero section, deferred non-critical JS.
* **Code splitting & lazy loading:** Dynamic imports for heavy components (map, calendar, gallery viewer).
* **Image optimization:** Use modern formats with automatic fallback. Pre-generate multiple sizes and use `srcset`.
* **Caching:** CDN caching with cache-control for static pages, stale-while-revalidate for APIs.
* **Metrics:** Lighthouse scores tracked in CI with thresholds to block regression.

---

## SEO & content strategy

* **Technical SEO:** Clean URLs, canonical tags, `hreflang` (if multiple locales), XML sitemap, robots.txt.
* **On-page SEO:** Title/meta templates, structured data JSON-LD for trips, semantic headings, and open graph tags for social sharing.
* **Content:** Long-form editorial posts tied to destination keywords and trip pages to capture long-tail organic traffic.

---

## Accessibility

* Performed manual keyboard testing and automated checks (axe) against core pages.
* Implemented skip links, high-contrast focus outlines, aria-labels for dynamic controls, accessible modals and dialogs.
* Documented accessibility trade-offs and a remediation plan for future sprints.

---

## Testing & QA

* **Unit tests:** Jest for utility functions and small components.
* **Integration tests:** Cypress for E2E flows — search, filter, trip detail, booking flow, login/reset.
* **Visual regression:** Chromatic or Percy snapshots for key pages.
* **Load testing:** k6 or Artillery to validate backend under expected peak loads.

---

## Security considerations

* **OWASP basics:** Input sanitization, parameterized queries, secure headers, and CSP where possible.
* **Secrets:** Encrypted environment variables in deployment platform; rotated keys for payment and email services.
* **Permissions:** Role-based access control in admin panel with audit logs for content changes.

## Challenges & solutions (examples you can adapt)

### Image-heavy pages causing slow LCP

**Solution:** Built an image pipeline (Sharp) to auto-generate AVIF/WebP, used low-quality image placeholders (LQIP) and preloading for the largest hero image.

### Search and filtering were slow with DB-only approach

**Solution:** Offloaded search to Algolia for instant results; implement incremental indexing on content updates.

### Keeping editorial workflow simple for non-technical editors

**Solution:** Implemented a lightweight CMS (Strapi) with content validation and media workflows, plus a custom admin UI for bulk edits.

### Managing SEO while using a JS framework

**Solution:** Used Next.js static generation for pages most likely to be crawled, server-rendered search endpoints for crawlers, and implemented server-side structured data.

## Results & impact (suggested placeholders — replace with real metrics)

* Organic traffic growth: **+X%** month-over-month after 3 months.
* Average page load time: **Y s** (desktop) / **Z s** (mobile) after optimization.
* Conversion rate (inquiry/booking): **A%**.
* Editorial publishing time cut from **N hours** to **M minutes** after CMS rollout.
