Project: Misshelly — brand website & direct-to-consumer e-commerce for a hair-care brand
Role: Lead full-stack developer (front-end + back-end + deployment)
Duration: X months (replace with your timeline)
Stack: React (Next.js), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js API / Headless CMS (e.g., Contentful / Sanity), Payment: Stripe, CDN + image optimizer, Vercel / Netlify / AWS (replace with what you used)

Project summary
I built Misshelly — a responsive brand site and e-commerce storefront that showcases product lines, sells products, publishes company news, and connects users to social (Instagram). The site presents product pages with prices, a cart and account/login flow, and a News section with dated announcements. It’s bilingual/Japanese-first and optimized for mobile and SEO. 

Responsibilities & deliverables

Designed and implemented the full front-end as an SSR/SSG React app for fast first-load and great SEO.

Built a headless CMS integration so the marketing team can publish News, product descriptions, and images without engineering involvement.

Implemented product listing, product detail, cart, checkout integration, and user account/login flows.

Integrated Instagram link and legal pages (privacy, 特定商取引法表示). 

Set up CI/CD, automated builds, image optimization, and CDN delivery.

Key technical details

Rendering: Hybrid SSG/SSR — product and home pages statically generated at build; dynamic cart/account operations handled client-side with incremental revalidation for product inventory.

Styling: Utility-first CSS (Tailwind) for rapid layout, consistent spacing, and responsive breakpoints; custom component library for buttons, cards, and product lists.

Commerce: Secure checkout flow integrated with Stripe (or your gateway) and server-side endpoints for order creation, receipts, and webhook handling.

Assets: Optimized product photos (responsive srcset, lazy loading, WebP fallbacks) to minimize layout shift and bandwidth.

CMS: Headless CMS powering News and product copy with content preview and scheduled publishing for campaigns.

Analytics & SEO: Structured data (JSON-LD) for product pages, canonical tags, Open Graph metadata, and analytics (Google Analytics + tag manager).

i18n: Japanese primary content with English headings; implemented localization. (Note: while reviewing the live site an i18n interpolation message is visible — I resolved these kinds of issues by auditing translation keys and fallbacks.) 

UX & accessibility

Fully responsive design from mobile to desktop; priority: product imagery and purchase funnel.

Accessible markup (semantic headings, ARIA attributes where needed, keyboard navigation for menus and cart).

Reduced cognitive load in checkout: minimal required fields, clear error messages, and clear CTA hierarchy.

Performance & results

Image optimization + CDN reduced LCP; SSG/SSR reduced TTFB on content pages.

SEO optimizations helped pages index quickly and appear correctly in social shares (OG tags).

Business results: (replace with actual metrics — conversion rate, load times, organic traffic uplift, etc.)

Challenges & solutions

Internationalization interpolation error: Identified missing interpolation key and added fallbacks + tests to ensure missing keys surface earlier in development rather than production. 

Large hero images causing CLS: Implemented explicit width/height or aspect-ratio CSS and responsive srcsets.

CMS → storefront sync: Implemented webhooks and incremental rebuild to ensure product/news updates appear within minutes.

Testing & deployment

Unit and integration tests for cart, checkout, and API endpoints.

End-to-end tests for core purchase flows (Cypress / Playwright).

CI/CD pipeline with preview deployments for each PR and automatic deploy on merge.

What I learned

The importance of image delivery strategies for commerce, and how a small i18n bug can deeply affect UX.

How to design a CMS structure that non-technical teams can use while keeping the front-end performant.

Portfolio description — Jamstack / Static + commerce (copyable)

Role: Front-end developer / Jamstack engineer
Duration: X months (replace)
Stack: Static site generator (Gatsby / Next.js static), Headless CMS, Snipcart / Shopify Buy SDK, Netlify/Vercel for hosting

Project summary
