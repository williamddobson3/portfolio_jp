Short summary (one-paragraph)

I led the end-to-end development of Hince (https://hince.jp/
) — a production web application delivering [brief one-line description of what Hince does]. I owned product planning, UI/UX, front-end development, backend API design, deployment and monitoring. I built a responsive, accessible, and SEO-friendly site with a componentized frontend and a robust, testable backend; implemented CI/CD, performance optimizations, security hardening, and analytics to measure product goals. (Replace bracketed items and tech names below with the exact details from your implementation.)

Project overview

Project: Hince — https://hince.jp/

Timeframe: [Start date] → [Launch date / Ongoing]
My role: Lead developer (product owner / full-stack developer / frontend engineer — choose the one that fits)
Team: [Solo / 2–3 devs / cross-functional team]
Goal: Deliver a fast, discoverable web experience that [primary business goal — e.g., helps users discover X, book Y, read Z, manage A].
Audience: [Target users — e.g., professionals, consumers, students]

Responsibilities

Defined product requirements and prioritized features with stakeholders.

Converted user flows and wireframes into a component library and production UI.

Implemented the frontend: responsive layout, accessibility, SEO, client routing and hydration strategies.

Built the backend API, data models, authentication, and integrations (search, payments, third-party APIs where applicable).

Set up CI/CD, automated tests, deployments, and monitoring.

Measured success with analytics, A/B tests, and iterative improvement.

Tech stack (template — swap to your exact stack)

Frontend: React + Next.js (SSR/SSG where appropriate), componentized UI, Tailwind CSS.

Backend / API: Node.js + Express (or Next.js API routes) / alternative: Django / Rails.

Database: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching/session).

Search: Algolia / ElasticSearch (if search/explore is important).

Auth: JWT or OAuth integration with [provider].

Hosting / Deployment: Vercel / Netlify for frontend; Docker + AWS ECS / DigitalOcean / Heroku for backend.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (lint → test → build → deploy).

Monitoring & Errors: Sentry for error tracking, Prometheus/Grafana or Datadog for metrics.

Analytics & SEO: Google Analytics / GA4, Search Console, structured data (JSON-LD) for rich results.

If your actual stack is different, replace each item above with your real technologies — the structure of the description will still fit.

Design & UX process

Conducted stakeholder interviews to define core user journeys and prioritized MVP features.

Created low-fidelity wireframes, then high-fidelity prototypes (Figma).

Built an accessible component library: buttons, forms, cards, modals, and layout primitives. Components were documented and used across pages to ensure consistency.

Implemented responsive breakpoints and mobile-first CSS to ensure consistent experience across phones, tablets, desktops.

Accessibility: semantic HTML, keyboard navigability, ARIA where needed, color contrast checks, and screen-reader testing on key flows.

Architecture & data flow

Frontend uses server-side rendering (SSR) for content pages that benefit from SEO, and client rendering for highly interactive areas.

Backend exposes RESTful (or GraphQL) APIs; endpoints are versioned and documented with OpenAPI/Swagger.

Caching strategy: CDN for static assets + edge caching (for SSG/SSR) and Redis for frequently accessed API results.

Security: HTTPS enforced, CSP headers, input validation and rate limiting on APIs, careful handling of secrets via environment variables and secrets manager.

Key features implemented

(List the features you actually built; sample phrasing below — replace with your real features)

Landing page with hero, feature highlights, and conversion CTA.

Feature/Detail pages with server-rendered metadata, open graph tags, and structured data for SEO.

User authentication (signup/login, password reset, session management).

Content management flow (CMS integration or admin panel) for non-technical editing.

Real-time / background jobs (e.g., email sending, scheduled syncs) implemented with worker queue.

Search & filtering with faceted results and debounced client queries.

Analytics events for funnel tracking and conversion measurement.

Performance & SEO optimizations

Prioritized Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) improvements: critical CSS inlined, images lazy-loaded, optimized image formats (AVIF/WebP), and used responsive srcset.

Reduced bundle size: code splitting, tree shaking, and dynamic imports for rarely used components.

Used HTTP caching headers + CDN (and stale-while-revalidate where appropriate) for static assets.

Implemented proper meta tags, canonical URLs, sitemaps, and structured data to maximize search visibility.

Testing & quality assurance

Linters and formatter (ESLint, Prettier) enforced via pre-commit hooks.

Unit tests for core logic (Jest / testing-library).

Integration/E2E tests for critical user flows (Cypress / Playwright).

Staging environment for QA and smoke tests prior to production deploys.

CI / CD and deployment

GitHub Actions pipeline: pull request → automated tests & linting → build → deploy to staging. Manual or automated promotion to production after smoke tests.

Dockerized services to ensure parity between environments.

Zero-downtime deploys using rolling updates or atomic deploys depending on hosting provider.

Observability & maintenance

Error tracking via Sentry with alerting rules for production errors.

Performance monitoring with synthetic checks and dashboards for response times and throughput.

Weekly/biweekly maintenance tasks: dependency updates, security scans, database vacuuming and backups.

Security & compliance

Secrets and credentials stored in a secrets manager; no secrets in the repo.

Implemented rate limits, input sanitization, and account lockout after repeated failed attempts.

GDPR-compliant consent banners (if relevant), data retention policies, and privacy policy updates.

Challenges & how I solved them

(Highlight the most important technical or product challenges and your solutions)

Challenge: Slow initial page load due to large images and a heavy JS bundle.
Solution: Converted images to modern formats, added lazy loading, and implemented code splitting and SSR for important pages. LCP improved by [X% — replace if you have numbers].

Challenge: Search needed to scale with growing content.
Solution: Introduced Algolia/ElasticSearch, moved search indexing to background jobs, added debounce and pagination on client to reduce load.

Challenge: Need for non-technical content updates.
Solution: Integrated a lightweight CMS / built an admin interface with role-based access control.

Results & impact

(If you have metrics, insert them. If you don’t, this is a template you can fill in.)

Launch KPIs: [e.g., “Reached 10k monthly visitors in X months”, “Reduced bounce rate by 18% after redesign”, “Increased signups by 42%”].

Performance: LCP reduced from [X]s to [Y]s; TTFB improved by [Z%].

Reliability: 99.9% uptime in the first quarter after launch.

Business: [e.g., “Revenue grew from ¥A to ¥B”, “Time-to-first-booking decreased by 30%”].

What I learned (and what I’d do next)

The importance of measuring product impact early; instrumenting analytics revealed that [insight].

Prioritize content and SEO early — server rendering and metadata paid off.

Future improvements: add feature flags for safer experimentation, further optimize critical rendering path, and run structured A/B tests to improve conversion.

Copy-ready experience statement (for resume / portfolio)

Lead developer for Hince (https://hince.jp/
