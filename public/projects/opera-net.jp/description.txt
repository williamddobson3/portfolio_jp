* UX consultant (information architecture and content strategy)
* DevOps owner (CI/CD, hosting and performance monitoring)

**Timeline**

* Discovery & planning: 1–2 weeks
* Design & prototyping: 1–2 weeks
* Implementation: 2–4 weeks
* Testing & polish: 1 week
* Launch & post-launch monitoring: ongoing

(adjust actual dates/times to your project timeline)

## Responsibilities and contributions

* Led requirements gathering with stakeholders and translated business needs into technical requirements.
* Designed the information architecture, sitemap, and content hierarchy.
* Built responsive UI components and page templates.
* Integrated CMS (or static generation) for editing and content publishing.
* Implemented SEO best-practices (structured data, canonical tags, meta tags, semantic HTML).
* Set up CI/CD pipeline, automated builds and deployments, and server configuration.
* Performed accessibility remediation (ARIA roles, keyboard focus, semantic markup).
* Implemented performance optimizations (image optimization, code-splitting, caching).
* Configured analytics, logging and uptime monitoring.

---

## Design & UX process

1. **Discovery & stakeholder interviews** — gathered business goals, target audiences, and content types.
2. **Content inventory & IA** — mapped content to pages, defined primary navigation, and prioritized calls-to-action.
3. **Wireframes** — low-fidelity wireframes to align layout and content blocks for desktop and mobile.
4. **Visual design** — crafted final UI components: hero, feature blocks, footer, contact forms; focused on typographic hierarchy and clear CTAs.
5. **Prototyping & usability checks** — verified reading/scanning flow and mobile navigation.

### Design decisions worth highlighting

* **Mobile-first approach** — ensures core content is accessible on small screens; desktop enhancements layered progressively.
* **Clear visual hierarchy** — large type for headlines, consistent spacing, and high-contrast CTAs to improve scanability and conversions.
* **Content-first layout** — prioritized content blocks and easy access to contact/CTA elements.

## Technical architecture & stack

Below is a typical stack that I used (adjust to your actual choices):

* **Frontend:** Static-site generator (e.g., Next.js / Nuxt.js / Gatsby) or server-side rendered framework; vanilla JS/TypeScript for components.
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first) or custom SASS; responsive design with CSS Grid & Flexbox.
* **Content management:** Headless CMS (e.g., Contentful, Netlify CMS) or Markdown + Git workflow for content updates.
* **Backend / APIs:** Node.js serverless functions (if dynamic features) or none if fully static.
* **Hosting / CDN:** Vercel / Netlify / AWS S3 + CloudFront for static assets.
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
* **Performance & monitoring:** Lighthouse, Google PageSpeed, Sentry (errors), UptimeRobot or Datadog for availability.
* **Analytics:** Google Analytics or Plausible; events for CTAs and form submissions.

### Architecture notes

* Pages are generated from templates and content sources. Shared components are atomic and re-usable.
* Assets served through a CDN with cache-control headers and hashed filenames for long-term caching.
* Critical CSS and lazy-loading used to reduce first paint time.

## Key features & implementation details

Below are the important features I developed and the specific technical/UX choices I implemented.

### 1. Responsive, accessible layout

* Implemented semantic HTML5 structure (`header`, `main`, `article`, `footer`) for accessibility and SEO.
* Mobile-first CSS and breakpoints for tablet/desktop.
* Focus states for interactive elements and ARIA attributes where necessary.
* Keyboard navigation tested across pages.

### 2. Performance optimizations

* **Images:** Used responsive `srcset` and `picture` with modern formats (WebP/AVIF) and sized images to device widths. Automated image optimization pipeline during build.
* **Code-splitting:** Split vendor and page-specific bundles to reduce initial JS payload.
* **Lazy loading:** Implemented `loading="lazy"` for offscreen images; deferred non-critical scripts.
* **Caching:** Configured long-lived cache headers and CDN invalidation strategy after deploys.
* **Critical CSS:** Extracted minimal CSS for above-the-fold rendering.

### 3. SEO & structured data

* Implemented page-level meta tags (title, description), Open Graph tags, and Twitter card metadata.
* Added JSON-LD structured data for the Organization / Website schema to help search engines.
* Generated and served `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` automatically.
* Used semantic heading order (h1 → h2 → h3) to preserve content hierarchy.

### 4. Content workflow

* Implemented either a headless CMS or a git-based content workflow (Markdown) so non-technical editors could publish content.
* Built canonical page templates, SEO fields in CMS, and preview hooks for content editors (if applicable).

### 5. Contact & forms

* Built a lightweight contact form with validation (client + server) and spam mitigation (honeypot or CAPTCHA as needed).
* Integrated form submissions with email via transactional provider (SES, SendGrid) or webhook.

### 6. Security

* Enforced HTTPS via CDN/TLS.
* Sanitized and validated any user-supplied content server-side.
* Set secure headers (HSTS, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options) at the CDN or server level.

---

## Testing strategy

* **Unit tests** for core JS utilities and form validation logic.
* **Visual regression checks** (Chromatic or Percy) to detect unintended UI regressions.
* **Accessibility testing:** automated checks with axe-core + manual spot checks (screen reader navigation and keyboard-only navigation).
* **E2E testing:** Cypress or Playwright to validate critical flows (form submission, navigation, contact CTA).
* **Performance monitoring:** Lighthouse audits during CI and post-deploy synthetic checks.

---

## CI/CD & deployment

* **CI pipeline:** On push to `main`, run linting, unit tests, Lighthouse smoke tests, and build.
* **Preview deploys:** Automatic preview URLs for pull requests for stakeholder review.
* **Production deploys:** Atomic, immutable builds deployed to CDN with zero-downtime.

---

## Observability & analytics

* **Analytics:** Tracked pageviews, CTA clicks, and form submissions; set up conversion goals in analytics.
* **Error reporting:** Sentry for frontend runtime errors.
* **Uptime & performance:** Synthetic checks to alert on regressions in lighthouse metrics or downtime.

---

## Challenges & solutions

1. **Balancing rich visuals with load speed**

   * *Problem:* High-resolution imagery increased load times.
   * *Solution:* Implemented responsive images, progressive loading, and served modern formats. Replaced hero video with optimized Lottie/animated SVG where appropriate.

2. **SEO for dynamic pages**

   * *Problem:* Some content was generated client-side which reduced SEO effectiveness.
   * *Solution:* Shifted to server-side rendering or static generation for key pages and ensured metadata is present at HTML render time.

3. **Content editing for non-technical users**

   * *Problem:* Stakeholders needed simple publishing workflows.
   * *Solution:* Integrated a headless CMS with structured fields, preview links, and training for editors.

## Outcomes & recommended metrics to include in portfolio (replace with your actual numbers)

* **Performance:** Lighthouse Performance score improved to **XX** (desktop) and **YY** (mobile).
* **Load time:** Time to interactive reduced to **Z.Zs**.
* **SEO:** Organic search impressions / sessions increased by **N%** within M months.
* **Accessibility:** Achieved WCAG AA compliance on core pages; automated axe checks show 0 critical issues.
* **Reliability:** Uptime maintained at **99.9%+** after deployment.

> Replace the placeholders with real analytics and Lighthouse numbers from your monitoring tools to strengthen the case study.

## What I learned

* The importance of aligning content strategy early — content dictates layout more than the other way around.
* Small, well-targeted performance improvements (image formats, caching, and code-splitting) yield outsized improvements in perceived speed.
* Investing in editor UX (CMS structure & preview) reduces content errors and speeds up publishing.

## Notes about presenting this in a portfolio

* Start with a compelling headline and one-sentence summary of impact.
* Use the TL;DR and the Outcomes as the lead content so busy recruiters see impact immediately.
* Use the "Suggested screenshots" list to arrange visuals — visuals should show mobile and desktop and at least one technical screenshot.
* Keep a short technical section that lists exact tools and versions used.
