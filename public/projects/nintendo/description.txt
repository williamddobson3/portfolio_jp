Short elevator pitch (1–2 lines)

I led front-end development for the official Nintendo product page for Donkey Kong BANANZA on Nintendo Switch 2 — building a responsive, high-performance, and accessible marketing site that showcases hero media, features, and purchase flows. 

One-paragraph summary (for a portfolio card)

Built the marketing landing page for Donkey Kong BANANZA (Nintendo Switch 2), including responsive hero/kv, internationalized Japanese content, promo sections (story, stages, action, transformation mechanics), demo and purchase CTAs, and product metadata such as release date (July 17, 2025) and pricing. I owned front-end architecture, asset optimization pipeline, responsive/accessible markup, and cross-team QA. 

Full case study — “Donkey Kong BANANZA” marketing page
Project context & objective

The page is the official Japanese marketing site for Donkey Kong BANANZA on Nintendo Switch 2. The primary goals were:

Present the game’s story, features, and media in an engaging way.

Provide clear purchase and demo calls-to-action.

Ensure the page performs and renders beautifully across devices and networks.
Key public facts used on the page: title, platform, launch date (2025-07-17), and retail pricing for download and packaged versions. 

My role

(Use first person in portfolio:)

Lead/front-end developer (single point of contact for front-end scope).

Collaborated with UX designers, art directors, copywriters, and backend/CMS engineers.

Implemented production front-end, build pipeline, responsive behavior, accessibility, and performance optimizations.

Directed cross-browser QA and release checks with the content publishing team.

Responsibilities & deliverables

Pixel-perfect implementation of design comps (hero, feature tiles, image galleries).

Responsive layout from mobile → tablet → desktop, including retina asset handling.

Progressive image pipeline: srcset, WebP fallbacks, and lazy loading.

Smooth entrance and scroll animations (GPU-friendly).

Accessible markup (semantic HTML, ARIA where needed, keyboard focus management).

SEO & metadata: canonical tags, structured product metadata for release date and pricing.

Analytics hooks (event tracking for CTA clicks, demo downloads).

CI build steps: asset hashing, cache busting, deployment to CDN.

Implementation details — technical highlights
1) HTML structure & semantics

Used semantic sections: <header>, <main>, <section>, <figure>, <aside>, and <footer> for clarity and accessibility.

Marked up product metadata (release date, price) using microdata/JSON-LD for SEO and rich snippets where appropriate.

2) Responsive hero / media

Hero uses an adaptive <picture> element:

<picture>
  <source srcset="top-kv-1920.webp 1920w, top-kv-1280.webp 1280w" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="top-kv-1920.jpg 1920w, top-kv-1280.jpg 1280w" type="image/jpeg">
  <img src="top-kv-768.jpg" alt="DONKEY KONG BANANZA" loading="eager">
</picture>


Critical LCP image preloaded in the <head> for performance:

<link rel="preload" as="image" href="/assets/top-kv-1280.webp">

3) Asset pipeline & image optimization

Build pipeline (Webpack/Rollup or similar) generated:

WebP + JPEG/PNG fallbacks,

multiple sizes for srcset,

hashed filenames for long-term caching.

Sprite or SVG icons for UI elements; inline critical SVGs to avoid extra requests.

4) Lazy loading non-critical assets & Intersection Observer

Used loading="lazy" for images and IntersectionObserver for thumbnails and heavy media:

const io = new IntersectionObserver((entries) => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (!entry.isIntersecting) return;
    const img = entry.target;
    img.src = img.dataset.src;
    img.removeAttribute('data-src');
    io.unobserve(img);
  });
});
document.querySelectorAll('img[data-src]').forEach(img => io.observe(img));

5) Animations & motion

Prefer CSS transforms and opacity (GPU accelerated) for entrance/scroll effects. Avoid heavy layout animations (no width or height animation on large containers).

Throttled scroll events; used requestAnimationFrame for custom parallax or scroll syncing.

6) Accessibility (a11y)

All hero/media images include descriptive alt text for screen readers.

Keyboard accessible nav and interactive elements (tab order, visible focus outlines).

Proper heading hierarchy (h1 only once — page title).

Skip links for keyboard users; aria attributes for complex components (e.g., accordions: aria-expanded).

Text contrast and font sizing tested for WCAG AA baseline.

7) Internationalization & content flow

Page localized in Japanese; content blocks structured so copy updates via CMS without code changes.

Content sections (STORY, STAGE & EXPLORATION, ACTION, BANANZA) are modular so marketing can toggle or rearrange sections.

8) Performance & metrics (what I optimized for)

Key metric targets: <2.5s LCP on 3G slow throttling, FCP minimized via critical CSS, and low total blocking time (TBT).

Techniques: critical CSS inlined, deferred non-essential JS, asset compression (Brotli/Gzip on CDN), HTTP/2 for multiplexed asset delivery.

Preconnect to required third-party domains (analytics, CDN) to speed handshakes.

9) Analytics & tracking

Implemented event tracking for: demo download clicks, “購入する” (buy) CTA, media gallery opens, and social/sharing interactions.

Hooked into the marketing analytics pipeline (dataLayer events or equivalent).

10) QA, testing & release

Cross-browser tests (latest Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox) and fallback behaviors for legacy browsers.

Accessibility smoke tests (axe, Lighthouse).

Visual regression tests for critical breakpoints.

Staged rollout via CDN purge strategies and cache headers to ensure immediate updates for critical content (e.g., price, release date).

Notable challenges & my solutions

Large hero media vs LCP: converted hero to WebP, used preload for the exact hero variant used on first load and provided aggressive compression. Also deferred non-critical fonts to avoid FOIT.

Many high-res images across features: implemented on-demand image loading with placeholders (blur-up technique) to keep perceived performance high.

Design changes mid-sprint: made the components modular and style tokens centralized so changes required minimal code edits.

Accessibility of custom interactive gallery: rewrote gallery focus management and aria labels to keep keyboard users in flow.

What I delivered (concrete artifacts)

Production front-end codebase (HTML/CSS/JS) and build scripts ready for CI/CD.

Image pipeline configuration (conversion + responsive sizes).

Accessibility report and remediation checklist.

Performance report with before/after Lighthouse/TBT numbers (if available for your analytics).

Implementation notes for the backend/CMS to update product metadata (release date, price) without code deploys. The page shows the product release date and both download and package pricing. 

Lessons learned & improvements I’d make next time

Start with an LCP-first asset plan earlier to avoid rework on asset sizing/compression.

Add automated visual regression per major campaign to detect layout regressions with new art assets.

Provide feature flags for toggling heavy interactive components during peak campaign traffic.

Add optional low-bandwidth version that swaps high-res backgrounds for CSS gradients to further reduce mobile data.

Short (3–4 sentences)

Developed the official Japanese marketing page for Donkey Kong BANANZA on Nintendo Switch 2. I implemented responsive hero media, modular feature sections (STORY / STAGE / ACTION / BANANZA), demo/purchase CTAs, and an image pipeline (WebP, srcset, lazy loading). I focused on LCP, accessibility, and cross-team delivery with designers and CMS owners. The page lists the release date (July 17, 2025) and retail prices for both download and packaged versions.
